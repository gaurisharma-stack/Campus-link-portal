# Campus Maintenance Portal

A web-based complaint management system designed for campuses, hostels, or residential societies. The application allows users to submit maintenance issues and enables administrators to track, manage, and resolve them efficiently.

---

## Overview

The Campus Maintenance Portal provides a centralized platform where residents can report problems such as plumbing, electrical, or other maintenance issues. Each complaint is assigned a unique ticket ID so that it can be tracked and managed easily by the admin team.

This project demonstrates the integration of frontend technologies with a Python backend using Flask.
